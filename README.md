# Decision-Tree
This is a programming assignment done for the CSCI 567 - Machine Learning class.

dt.py and utils.py implements the algorithm for Decision Trees. This is a complete implementation that is also provided with a test dataset on cars.

This algorithm is implmented using a recursive approach where Tree and child relationship is represented by array of pointers.

To run the above code: $ python dt_test_script.py
